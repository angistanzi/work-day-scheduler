# Work Day Scheduler
This simple web app is a work day scheduler that allows users to view color-coded time blocks and save tasks to the scheduler via local storage.

Past hours and events should appear grey, the current hour will appear red, and future hours will appear green.

Access the app here: https://angistanzi.github.io/work-day-scheduler/
